/* There is a problem of percentage. It is responsive for every screen size. Suppose, we have defined max width of 75% for medium screen and max width of 60% for large screen. Large screen's breakpoint is 1024. So, at 1024px, width will be 60%. But even at 1023px, the width will be 75%. As 1023px is considered as a medium screen. */
